# ML_prediction_for_Adoption

PROJECT SYNOPSIS:-
As, we know Only  Parents wish is taken into consideration while they apply for adoption , the child mostly has an existing trauma from past life which could lead to RAD and other disorders so through the survey we check the eligiblity and compatibility of parents with children (child or teen) and accordingly based on their scores in each section 
the model predicts the result for them . Based on the results the parents can see if they are eligible or not , if eligible for a child or not and lastly if eligible for a teen
or not based on the statements displayed . This is just an attempt to give parents an insight as to what would be a better option for them to proceed with and at the end of the day its the adoptee parents choice .

NOTE:- In no way am I promoting this project as real or efficient because it doesn't contain real data ( the traing data is created by a program) , but yes its an initative to atleast try to solve a real life problem through the use of ML . 

FLOW OF PROJECT 

1) CREATE TRAINING DATA 
-combination_code for all 3 datasets.ipynb
-eg:- for combo1.csv
      -add  the responses in each section (eg:-add responses gained from child related quest and based on total generate child label) 
      -label generation :- condition for label generation.txt
      
2) FILL THE  Adoption_survey.html
3) AFTER SUBMITTING THE FORM THE RESULT IS SAVED IN AN HTML FILE (data.html)
- the file is used  as an input in TableToCsv.py to generate and give us a csv file (Adoption_data.csv)
4) SPLIT THE CSV INTO 3 CSV (child.csv,adolescent.csv,common.csv)
5) 3 DECISION TREE CLASSIFIER FOR 3 CSV
- save the results in .pkl file 
6) MERGE THE RESULTS AND CHECK IF ELSE CONDITION


SUMMARY OF FLOW :- 
Survey responses are gathered from the Adoption_survey.html which are then processed further by downloading those responses using pyautogui (save_data.csv) in html table format  and 
convert them to csv files (TableToCsv.py) using beautifulsoup package in python 
Based on the questions the files are splitted into 3 seperate csv files namely child.csv,adolescent.csv,common.csv.(split_csv.py)

TRAINING DATA - data is generated by a combination program ( combination_code for all 3 datasets.ipynb) and the label generation logic can be 
found in (condition for label generation.txt)

TEST DATA-
3 Decision tree Classification are used as ML predictor on 3 csv(child.csv,adolescent.csv,common.csv) and their model results are saved in .pkl file
which are used to store the output either 1 or 0

Lastly we concatenate all outputs from the 3 decision tree models and based on the code formed we give an if else conditions , then a statement is displayed stating eligible or not eligible .
